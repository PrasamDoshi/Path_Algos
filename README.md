# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a Pathfinding Visualizer built using Pygame. It allows users to visualize and compare the performance of three pathfinding algorithms: A* (Astar), Dijkstra's, and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## Features

- Visualize A*, Dijkstra's, and BFS algorithms.
- Interactive grid where users can set start and end nodes.
- Add or remove walls to create obstacles.
- Smooth transitions and animations to illustrate the pathfinding process.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrasamDoshi/Path_Algos.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Run the main application script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The Pygame window will open. Follow the instructions below to interact with the visualizer.

## Usage

- **Select the algorithm **
- **Select Start Node**: Click on the grid to place the start node.
- **Select End Node**: Click on the grid to place the end node.
- **Add Walls**: Click on the grid to add walls (obstacles).
- **Remove Walls**: Right-click on the grid to remove walls.
- **Run Algorithm**: Press `Space` to run the selected algorithm.
- **Reset Grid**: Press `C` to reset the grid and clear all nodes and walls.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: The main application file containing the visualizer logicand implementation of the pathfinding algorithms.
